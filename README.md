# Personal-Schedule-Tracker-V2



*** WHAT IS THIS ***

This is an updated version from my very first personal schedule tracker. This is a more fleshed out and in depth version. This is a significant upgrade where it warrants it being the version two although a lot of work still needs to be done to make this program a final product; It is however very usable and functional. This is a Java program that creates a GUI using JavaFX and a window pops up where the user can interact with a text box and a button to create a schedule. Once all the information has been input into the program a Text file will be created with the users information and will be easy to read.
Please take a look at the working proof folder in this repository to see how it looks like and proof that it actually works



*** HOW TO START ***

This program was used and created using VS code, therefore there is a VS code format folder that I would suggest you download as well. This is because the launch.json file necessary to run the program has a section where you have to paste the location of the library for the JavaFX jar files needed to run this program in the first place. Once the correct formatting of the launch.json file has been made, the src folder is where the actual program resides. Simply run the java file name “PST” to get the schedule builder running.



*** NOTES FROM ME ***

I've been working on this version from 6/2024 - 10/2024.
I recognize that it is not at all optimal and quite frankly looks very horrible as graphic design is not my passion, however it is functional and it does work and I actually quite like this improvement over the last version. Similarly to version 1, I also actually use this and I hope this helps you as it helps me make my schedules.



*** FUTURE UPDDATES PLANNED ***

The UI will be left the same as although it is very barbaric it is still functional. I am however planning to update and streamline the code to be more optimal. The following repository will be version 2.1. I am also hoping to use a scene builder to make it look more like an actual professional application but that will be version 3.

Once again thank you very much for your time
